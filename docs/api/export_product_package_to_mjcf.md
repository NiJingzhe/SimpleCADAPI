## Import Surface

- exporter namespace: `from simplecadapi import exporter` then `exporter.mjcf.export_product_package_to_mjcf(...)`

## Description

Compile a validated `.scadpkg` assembly into an MJCF model.
Fixed constraints create rigid groups. Public connector declarations resolve
endpoint ownership to their leaf connectors without changing the constraint
kind. Revolute/prismatic edges form a deterministic spanning tree. Gear,
belt, and rack-pinion relations become independent fixed-tendon
equalities. Root assembly connectors and geometry names in the
``interface.*`` namespace become MJCF sites.
