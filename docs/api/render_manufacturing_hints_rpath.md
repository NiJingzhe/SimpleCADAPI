## Import Surface

- inspection namespace: `from simplecadapi.inspect import brep` then `brep.render_manufacturing_hints_rpath(...)`; unavailable inside GraphSession/@model

## Description

Render manufacturing hints as deterministic category-colored overlays.

Sheet-metal skins are blue, bends are orange, fillet candidates are red,
and chamfer candidates are yellow. Analysis always runs against the current
model so entity IDs cannot be reused across different BREP instances.
