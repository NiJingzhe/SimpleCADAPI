# Workflow: Engineering Drawing Generation

Produce a GB-standard engineering drawing sheet set (DXF + PNG) from an
already-validated part or product. This is a preliminary workflow; drawing is
an output stage, so geometry must be final before entry. Layout follows the
engine's division of labor: the solver computes deterministic truth
(projection, measurements, collisions, rules R1–R7), and the agent refines
the layout through a validate-and-rollback action loop.

Read `domains/engineering-drawing.md` first — this workflow does not repeat
its solver rules or engine boundaries.

Standing discipline, binding for every role:

- **Geometry first, drawing second.** Enter only with validated geometry and
  a settled datum story. A drawing never repairs a model; it exposes one.
- **Engine truth, agent choice.** Every validity judgment (collision, R1–R7,
  coverage) is computed by the engine. The agent only arbitrates discrete
  choices (which side/row, which trade-off) through actions the engine
  validates or rejects with reasons. Never hand-edit a rendered DXF or PNG.
- **Declare, then arbitrate.** Start from semantic declarations
  (`SheetDecl` + friends); run the action loop only on what the solver could
  not place cleanly. Actions refine a solvable declaration; they are not a
  substitute for one.
- **The action log is the decision log.** Every layout change is an action
  in a replayable JSON file. Rebuilding from declarations plus replaying the
  action file must reproduce the sheet byte-for-byte.
- **Audit before render; two artifacts, one truth.** `report()` is reviewed
  before rendering, and visual acceptance means reading the PNG rendered
  from the DXF — "no rule conflicts" alone is not acceptance.

## Role map

| # | Role | Reads (load before acting) | Produces | Exit gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Drawing Requirement Confirmer | `domains/requirement-refinement.md`, `domains/engineering-drawing.md`, model requirements (`REQUIREMENTS.md`/`BUILD_PLAN.md` if present) | `<part-dir>/DRAWING.md` | ⛔ user consent received |
| 2 | Sheet Planner | `DRAWING.md`, `discipline/datums-and-coordinate-systems.md` | per-sheet view/datum/dimension roster + R5 coverage ledger | plan presented |
| 3 | Layout Arbiter | sheet plan, `domains/engineering-drawing.md`, declaration/action API pages | sheet declarations, action-log JSONs, solver-clean report | `report()` R1–R7 ok or accepted-with-reason, R5 no `MISS`, no open warnings |
| 4 | Visual Reviewer | rendered PNG only | structured verdict | verdict pass; failures become `repair:` items for Role 3 |
| 5 | Drawing Exporter | verdict-passed action logs, `domains/engineering-drawing.md` | final DXF + PNG + archived action logs | artifacts re-open cleanly |

## Role-switch protocol

Before starting a role's work, output exactly:

```markdown
## [Role Switch: <Role Name>]
Reading: <role-owned files>
Artifact out: <path>
```

Then act only inside that role's scope. Roles 3 and 4 alternate per sheet:

```text
Sheet_1: Role 3 declare + action loop -> Role 4 render verdict -> (repair:)*
Sheet_2: Role 3 declare + action loop -> Role 4 render verdict -> (repair:)*
...
```

A failed verdict does not advance the sheet; it appends a `repair:` item
owned by the declarations or the action log, whichever owns the failure, and
repeats the same Role 3/4 loop.

## Role 1 — Drawing Requirement Confirmer ⛔

Convert the request into `DRAWING.md`. No declarations, no renders before
this gate closes.

1. Carry over the model's settled facts (geometry validated, parameters
   named). Do not reopen modeling decisions here.
2. Decide-or-ask the drawing-level choices: sheet scale, view set (which
   views, which sheet each lives on), datum letters, which parameters are
   manufacturing-critical, and the notes/parameter-table split.
3. Batch every blocking ambiguity into ONE ask round with conservative
   defaults first (`domains/requirement-refinement.md`). Record the rest in
   the Ask-or-Record ledger with basis.

Write `DRAWING.md` with: scale; per-sheet view roster; datum scheme;
dimension roster seeds (parameter → kind/semantic guess); R5 ledger skeleton
(every parameter → dimension carrier or notes/table); open assumptions.

Gate: the ask round returned and consent is recorded. Entering Role 2
without this gate is the cardinal violation.

## Role 2 — Sheet Planner

From `DRAWING.md` only — no API detail, no coordinates.

1. Per sheet, fix the view set and alignment structure (front view anchored;
   every other view `align`ed to it — 长对正 / 高平齐 by construction, never
   by offsets).
2. Fix the datum scheme consistent with the model's functional interfaces
   (`discipline/datums-and-coordinate-systems.md`).
3. Produce the dimension roster: for each parameter, its carrier dimension
   (kind, semantic, view, reference datum) or its notes/parameter-table
   destination. This roster IS the R5 coverage ledger.
4. Flag parameters the engine cannot express yet (engine boundaries in the
   domain page) and route them to notes explicitly — never silently.

Present the plan in ≤10 lines. No approval gate; enter the Role 3/4 loop.

## Role 3 — Layout Arbiter

Owns declarations and the agent-in-the-loop refinement cycle.

**Phase A — declare.** Author the `SheetDecl` per sheet from the roster:
`ViewDecl`s with `align`, `DatumDecl`s first, `DimDecl`s with `covers`,
`CenterDecl`/`LeaderDecl` as planned. Solve, print `report()`, and read it
line by line: fix declaration-level problems (wrong view, missing datum
reference, duplicate measurement) by re-declaring, not by actions.

**Phase B — the action loop.** For everything the solver placed with
warnings or left unsolved, iterate:

1. **See.** Render the annotated review image (`viz`): gray = placed ok,
   blue = unsolved, red = warning, orange = accepted-with-reason; green
   arrows show each element's free movement corridors (how far it can
   translate, per direction). Read the red and blue elements first.
2. **Measure.** Call `plan.evaluate()` and read the exact, digested numbers
   for the failing elements: per-element `violations` (what it hits, where,
   by how much) and `corridors` (free translation distances). Work from
   these quantities — never from re-derived raw geometry.
3. **Propose.** Compose the next action-log JSON: one action per decision
   (`rad`/`dia`/`lin`/`lead` position adjustments, `accept` to bless a
   warning with a recorded reason). Actions are discrete choices — which
   side, which row, which trade-off (R1 squeeze vs arrow-off-arc vs new
   azimuth) — arbitrated by you, the agent.
4. **Submit.** Replay via `plan.apply(actions)`: the engine validates each
   action and rejects bad ones with `violations`/`corridors` residuals,
   rolling the sheet back to the last consistent state. A rejection is data,
   not failure: read the residuals, revise the action, resubmit.
5. **Verify blast radius.** Diff the previous and new action logs (pixel
   diff of the two replays): red = newly covered, blue = vacated, gray =
   untouched. Confirm the action moved only what you intended.
6. Loop 1–5 until every element is gray or orange (warn = 0), then run the
   full `report()` audit once more.

Exit gate: `report()` shows R1–R7 ok or accepted-with-reason, the R5
coverage table has no `MISS`, and no red/blue elements remain. Drive the
loop directly against `SheetPlan` (solve / evaluate / apply / render);
declaring `SheetDecl.diag_png` makes every solve/apply auto-refresh the
annotated conflict image and return a must-read instruction with it.

## Role 4 — Visual Reviewer

Rendered-PNG-only judgment, delegated in the same spirit as image verdicts
in `workflows/single-part-modeling.md`: the reviewer sees the artifacts, not
the reasoning.

1. Read the PNG rendered from the final DXF (both sheets if multiple).
2. Check, in order: views aligned as planned; hidden lines (虚线) and center
   lines present; arrows touch their geometry; texts sit clear of lines;
   datum boxes legible; the dimension arrangement communicates design intent
   (a formally clean sheet can still mislead — e.g. dimensioning a derived
   length instead of the functional one).
3. Emit a structured verdict: pass, or an itemized list where each item
   names the owning artifact (declaration or action log).

A failed item becomes a `repair:` item for Role 3. Never patch the DXF.

## Role 5 — Drawing Exporter

1. Final render: `plan.render(dxf, png)` per sheet from the verdict-passed
   state (declarations + replayed action logs).
2. Re-open the DXF (e.g. via `ezdxf`) and check the entity count matches the
   render report; confirm both artifacts regenerate deterministically from
   the same inputs.
3. Deliver: DXF + PNG paths plus the archived action-log JSONs (they are
   part of the deliverable — the reproducible decision history).

## Acceptance

- `report()`: R1–R7 all ok, or accepted with recorded reasons.
- R5: every model parameter has a carrier; no `MISS`.
- Visual verdict passed; DXF re-opens with expected entity count; the sheet
  regenerates byte-for-byte from declarations + action log.
- Engine boundaries routed explicitly (notes/table), never silently dropped.

## Failure modes

- Entering with unvalidated geometry: every downstream conflict then looks
  like a drawing bug but is a model bug.
- Using actions to fight a wrong declaration: if `report()` shows structural
  problems (missing datum, duplicate measurement), re-declare — the action
  loop is for placement refinement, not for repairing semantics.
- Trusting "no conflicts" over the PNG, or skipping the diff step so one
  action silently relocates a neighbor.
- Losing the action log: without it the sheet is not reproducible; treat it
  as a deliverable, not scratch.
- Hitting engine boundaries (no sections/hatching; horizontal/vertical
  linear dims only; radius labels same-side outward): restructure the view
  set or record the limitation; do not simulate missing features with
  leader-note spam.
