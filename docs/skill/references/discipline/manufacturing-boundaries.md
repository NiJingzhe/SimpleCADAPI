# Discipline: Manufacturing Boundaries

What geometric modeling may and may not conclude about manufacturing. Numeric
defaults in this document are first-pass design heuristics, not SDK defaults.

## Evidence labels

- **SDK contract:** canonical length/angle units, product-package/export
  boundaries, and tolerance-analysis APIs.
- **Modeling guidance:** wall thickness, fillet, clearance-hole, and backlash
  starting values. They require user confirmation or an explicit assumption.

## Defaults are first-pass, not claims

When the user does not specify, these defaults keep a model reasonable — they
are not manufacturability, tolerance, or certification conclusions:

- **SDK contract:** canonical geometry lengths are millimeters and angles are
  degrees; declared units remain part of expression/model data.
- Output geometry: closed, positive-volume solids unless surfaces or
  construction geometry were explicitly requested.
- Small plastic enclosure wall: 2.0–3.0 mm.
- Cosmetic fillet: 1.0–3.0 mm when safe for local geometry.
- M3/M4/M5 normal clearance holes: 3.4/4.5/5.5 mm unless another standard is
  requested.
- Gear mesh backlash starting point: 0.05–0.1 × module — a design decision to
  record, not a hidden constant.

Report which defaults were applied; they are assumptions a reviewer wants to
see.

## What geometry proves

Geometric validation (closure, validity, positive volume, measurements,
solve residuals, replay) proves facts about the model: dimensions,
positions, relationships, kinematic structure. That is the full extent.

## What geometry never proves

Do not claim, from geometry alone:

- structural safety or adequate strength margins
- fatigue life
- thermal performance
- vibration or modal behavior
- tolerance-stack compliance (tolerance analysis must actually run and pass)
- complete manufacturability or DFM sign-off
- process certification or regulatory compliance

These require their own analysis with real inputs. If the user needs them,
say so and route to the appropriate analysis — do not soften the language
into implying them ("should be strong enough" is still a claim).

## Format responsibilities

Each export target carries only its own contract
(`../domains/export-and-translation.md`):

- `.scadpkg` is the editable, replayable SimpleCAD boundary — never treat STL
  or OBJ as an editable CAD source.
- STEP carries evaluated BREP and product structure, not feature history.
- STL is facet soup for additive manufacturing; OBJ adds shared vertices for
  DCC exchange. Neither is a validation substitute for the solid.
- MJCF carries simulation kinematics from the constraint graph; it is not a
  manufacturing artifact.

## Dimension hygiene at the manufacturing boundary

- Exposed tunable dimensions are `var()`/`Var` declarations with optional
  unit and tolerance — the tolerance chain that matters downstream should be
  declared, not implied.
- Derived numbers (fits, cumulative offsets, conversions across many
  features) are computed, never freehanded.
- When a tolerance-chain question is the actual task, use the public tolerance
  APIs (`analyze_tolerance`, `check_tolerance`, `ToleranceAnalysis`,
  `ToleranceReport`) and report their output. `check_tolerance` returns a
  check result for a requirement; it does not choose the engineering
  requirement for you.

## Interaction with fabrication processes

Laser/waterjet/CNC handoff questions about 2D profiles, bend lines, and kerf
belong to the downstream fabrication tooling, not to this SDK's geometry
layer; export the geometry that represents the design and let the fabrication
preflight own its process rules. When a design decision affects
fabricability (wall thickness vs part size, hole diameters vs material),
surface it in the report as a flagged assumption rather than silently
optimizing it away.
