# Discipline: Mechanical Modeling

How to choose a construction strategy before selecting SimpleCADAPI operations.
This document separates SDK contracts from mechanical design guidance.

## Evidence labels

- **SDK contract** means behavior verified in the public API or generated API
  documentation.
- **Modeling guidance** is an engineering recommendation. The SDK does not
  infer manufacturing intent, strength, fit, or optimal feature order from it.

## Decide the construction before writing geometry

- **Make the spec's controlling dimensions direct named parameters.**
  Profile-driven shapes get one closed profile plus extrude/revolve/sweep/
  loft; block-and-feature parts get a base solid plus subtractive features.
  Choose whichever lets the user's dimensions appear as parameters instead of
  derived values.
- **Decide part vs assembly before modeling.** Bodies that are separately
  manufactured, purchased, or movable belong in an assembly with connectors
  and placements; monolithic manufacturing intent gets a single fused solid.
  Never leave a multi-body result where one labeled product was intended.
- **Pick the origin and orientation from the functional datum** — the mating
  interface, mounting plane, or symmetry axis — not from wherever the first
  primitive happened to land. See `datums-and-coordinate-systems.md`.
- **Model the part as a sequence of intentional operations**, not one opaque
  final shape: each feature is a named step, so a failed operation points at
  exactly one feature and a parameter change touches one obvious place.

## Build from low to high dimensionality

```text
Vertex / Edge / Wire / Face profiles
→ Solid features: extrude, revolve, sweep, loft
→ booleans for openings and merged bodies
→ detail: fillets, chamfers, shells last
```

**SDK contract:** keep replayable modeling operations in public API calls such as
`make_circle_rface`, `extrude_rsolid`, `cut_rsolid`, and `fillet_rsolid`; use
keyword arguments for documented public APIs. The SDK records graph operations
when a `GraphSession` is active, but it does not require every local helper to
be a one-line public call.

## Distinguish physical roles

- **Monolithic part**: one manufactured body, one fused solid.
- **Independent manufactured part**: own file, own `Part`, placed in the
  assembly.
- **Purchased/standard component**: stdlib factory or imported geometry with
  measured interfaces; never re-modeled by hand when a factory exists.
- **Motion component**: interfaces expressed as connectors; relations as
  declarative constraints (revolute/prismatic/gear/rack-pinion/belt).

## Parameters are design intent

- Every meaningful dimension is a named parameter in the file that consumes
  it; no magic numbers buried inside geometry calls.
- Exposed tunable parameters are `var()`/`Var` declarations (optionally with
  unit and tolerance); everything else is a plain constant in place.
- Numbers that are the result of computation (centers, radii from fits,
  cumulative offsets) are computed, never freehanded.

## Fastener envelopes precede geometry

When the part has fastened or mating features, derive the controlling
minimums before modeling and carry them as named parameters in the
brief — they are inputs, not patches after an interference check
fails:

- Countersink/counterbore: head diameter + shaft + wall/clearance ->
  minimum land diameter, minimum boss thickness, minimum edge distance.
- Insertion path: envelope swept along the assembly motion -> minimum
  lateral offset between the path and any neighboring material
  (e.g. rod-root offset >= head radius + rod radius + wall).
- The envelope that guarantees assemblability usually must also machine
  the clearance: design it as a cutting feature, and keep the check on
  its result rather than on the posture alone.

## Sanity-check proportions before generating

Compare the expected bounding box against the real-world object, wall
thickness against overall size, feature positions against edges and
neighbors. Order-of-magnitude and collision errors pass geometric validation
and fail only at review — catch them in the brief.

## What geometry cannot tell you

A valid, closed, positive-volume solid says nothing about strength, fatigue,
thermal behavior, vibration, tolerance compliance, or regulatory fitness.
Do not claim any of those without the corresponding analysis having actually
run. See `manufacturing-boundaries.md`.
