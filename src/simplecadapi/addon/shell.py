"""``sca init`` shell integration: make ``sca`` resolve in any new shell.

One ``sca init`` wires the command everywhere without the user touching
PATH by hand:

1. a shim directory ``~/.sca/bin`` holding a wrapper that execs the real
   console script living next to the interpreter that ran ``sca init``;
   the venv's own ``bin`` is never put on PATH (it would shadow ``python``
   and friends globally — the shim is surgical);
2. that directory on PATH: a marked, removable block in ``~/.zshenv``
   (zsh reads it in non-interactive shells too, so agents and scripts see
   the command; ``~/.zshrc`` would only serve interactive terminals),
   ``~/.bashrc`` (bash), ``~/.config/fish/conf.d/sca-path.fish`` (fish);
   on Windows, the user-scope ``PATH`` registry value (HKCU\\Environment)
   plus a broadcast so newly opened shells pick it up.

Only the marked block, the shim directory, and (Windows) the single PATH
entry are ever written. An rc file is created only for the user's login
shell or when it already exists — ``sca init`` never plants dotfiles for
shells that are not in use. ``--no-shell`` skips the step; re-running
``sca init`` after the install environment moves refreshes the shim.
Removal is manual by construction: delete the marked block(s) and
``~/.sca/bin`` (Windows: drop the ``.sca\\bin`` PATH entry).
