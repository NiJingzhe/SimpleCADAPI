"""``sca addon use``: run a command inside an installed addon's environment.

The addon's ``[runtime].command_prefix`` (a shell prelude, with
``{addon_dir}`` resolving to the installed addon payload and
``{runtime_dir}`` to the addon's private runtime-state directory beside the
addon home) is joined in front of the requested command and handed to the
shell, so ``sca addon use conn-tools python train.py`` executes with
exactly the environment the addon declares — its own venv, tool paths, or
variables — without the caller having to provision anything. The installed
addon directory is also exported as ``SCA_ADDON_DIR`` and its runtime
directory as ``SCA_RUNTIME_DIR``, so provisioning scripts can self-locate.

Calling without a command reports the effective prefix and directories
instead of executing anything.
